# CiOrchestrationServiceJobInfraFailureRatioErrorSLOViolation

## Overview

This alert fires when the infra-attributable share of CI job failures exceeds its SLO burn rate threshold, indicating that an unusually high proportion of job failures are caused by infrastructure issues rather than user errors.

The `job_infra_failure_ratio` SLI uses `gitlab_ci_job_failure_reasons` as both numerator and denominator: the error rate is the fraction of total job failures whose `reason` label matches an **explicit positive list** of infra-attributable reasons (e.g., `runner_system_failure`, `scheduler_failure`, `data_integrity_failure`). All other reasons — user/external errors like `script_failure`, and ambiguous reasons like `unknown_failure` — only contribute to the denominator. They are tracked separately in the Pipeline Observability dashboard's "Job failures - others" panel for anomaly detection.

The positive list lives in [`metrics-catalog/services/lib/ci-job-failure-reasons.libsonnet`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks/-/blob/master/metrics-catalog/services/lib/ci-job-failure-reasons.libsonnet) (`systemCausedReasons`) and is the single source of truth used by both the SLI and the dashboard.

### Impact

- CI jobs failing for reasons outside user control
- Reduced pipeline success rates across the platform
- User frustration and wasted compute (retries)
- Potential data integrity issues if `data_integrity_failure` is elevated

### Contributing Factors

Each entry is a reason in `systemCausedReasons` and a typical underlying cause:

- `runner_system_failure`: Runner panics, Kubernetes pod disruptions, trace patch failures, network egress issues
- `scheduler_failure`: Sidekiq job-scheduling failures
- `data_integrity_failure`: Internal consistency errors
- `environment_creation_failure`: Failure to create a deployment environment
- `job_router_failure`: Internal Job Router service failures
- `stuck_pending_with_matching_runners`: Jobs stuck pending despite available matching runners
- `no_updates_running` / `no_updates_canceling`: Job state machine not receiving heartbeats
- `stale_schedule`: Delayed jobs (`when: delayed`) left in `scheduled` state > 1h past their `scheduled_at`, dropped by `Ci::StuckBuilds::DropScheduledService`
- `stuck_or_timeout_failure` (legacy): retained for backward compatibility — pre-19.0 in-flight jobs and historical data ([gitlab#595752](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/595752))
- Gitaly overload causing clone/fetch failures (surfaces as `runner_system_failure`)
- Registry/Dependency Proxy issues causing image-pull failures (surfaces as `runner_system_failure`)

## Services

- [ci-orchestration service overview](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/ci-orchestration-main/ci-orchestration-overview)
- [Pipeline Observability dashboard](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/ci-orchestration-pipeline-observability)
- **Team**: [Verify](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/development/ops/verify/)
- **Slack**: `#s_verify_alerts`

## Metrics

The SLI uses the same metric for both request rate and error rate:

- **Request rate**: `rate(gitlab_ci_job_failure_reasons[5m])` — all job failures
- **Error rate**: `rate(gitlab_ci_job_failure_reasons{reason=~"<10 infra-attributable reasons>"}[5m])` — failures whose `reason` matches the positive include list (source of truth: [`services/lib/ci-job-failure-reasons.libsonnet`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks/-/blob/master/metrics-catalog/services/lib/ci-job-failure-reasons.libsonnet))
- **Emitted by**: `api`, `sidekiq`, `web`
- **SLO**: 95% success rate (errorRatio: 0.95, meaning max 5% infra failure share)
- **MWMBR fires at**: > 30% infra share (6h window) / > 72% (1h window — in practice dominated by the 6h window)

### Counted reasons (infra-attributable)

The error rate counter matches these reasons, defined in [`services/lib/ci-job-failure-reasons.libsonnet`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/runbooks/-/blob/master/metrics-catalog/services/lib/ci-job-failure-reasons.libsonnet) as `systemCausedReasons`:

`runner_system_failure`, `scheduler_failure`, `stuck_pending_with_matching_runners`, `no_updates_running`, `no_updates_canceling`, `data_integrity_failure`, `environment_creation_failure`, `job_router_failure`, `stale_schedule`, `stuck_or_timeout_failure` (legacy — kept for backward compatibility)

### Reasons NOT counted

Every other `reason` value is treated as non-infra and contributes only to the denominator. Notable examples:

- User/external-attributable: `script_failure`, `ci_quota_exceeded`, `no_matching_runner`, `runner_unsupported`, `job_execution_timeout`, `missing_dependency_failure`, etc.
- Ambiguous: `unknown_failure` (catch-all for unrecognised runner-side failure reasons)
- Runner-classified (introduced via [gitlab#595703](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/work_items/595703)): `runner_configuration_error`, `runner_external_dependency_failure`, `runner_interrupted`

These appear in the Pipeline Observability dashboard's "Job failures - others" panel for separate anomaly detection.

## Alert Behavior

- Severity: S3 (Slack-only, no paging)
- Routes to: `#s_verify_alerts`
- MWMBR requires both the short window (5m/1h) and long window (30m/6h) to breach simultaneously
- The ratio can spike during incidents affecting runners or Gitaly
- **Silencing**: Safe to silence during known runner fleet maintenance or Gitaly incidents where the root cause is already being addressed. Use Alertmanager silence with matchers `type=ci-orchestration, component=job_infra_failure_ratio`
- **Expected frequency**: May fire during infrastructure incidents. Under normal conditions, the infra failure share is well below the 5% SLO ceiling

## Severities

Default severity is S3. Consider upgrading to S2 if:

- Infra failure ratio > 5% sustained for > 30 minutes
- A single failure reason dominates (e.g., `runner_system_failure` spike indicating fleet-wide runner issue)
- Correlated with multiple customer reports

## Verification

```promql
# Current infra failure ratio (pre-aggregated)
gitlab_component_errors:ratio_5m{component="job_infra_failure_ratio", type="ci-orchestration", environment="gprd"}

# Breakdown by infra failure reason (matches the SLI's positive include list)
sum by (reason) (sli_aggregations:gitlab_ci_job_failure_reasons:rate_5m{environment="gprd", reason=~"runner_system_failure|scheduler_failure|stuck_pending_with_matching_runners|no_updates_running|no_updates_canceling|data_integrity_failure|environment_creation_failure|job_router_failure|stale_schedule|stuck_or_timeout_failure"})

# All other reasons (non-infra), for context
sum by (reason) (sli_aggregations:gitlab_ci_job_failure_reasons:rate_5m{environment="gprd", reason!~"runner_system_failure|scheduler_failure|stuck_pending_with_matching_runners|no_updates_running|no_updates_canceling|data_integrity_failure|environment_creation_failure|job_router_failure|stale_schedule|stuck_or_timeout_failure"})

## Troubleshooting

### 1. Identify the Dominant Failure Reason

Check the "Job failures - system-caused" panel on the Pipeline Observability dashboard. The top reason by volume tells you where to investigate:

| Reason | Investigate |
| ------ | ----------- |
| `runner_system_failure` | Runner fleet health, Kubernetes node issues, runner manager logs, network egress |
| `scheduler_failure` | Sidekiq scheduling issues |
| `data_integrity_failure` | Database consistency, recent migrations |
| `environment_creation_failure` | Deployment-environment APIs, infrastructure provisioning |
| `job_router_failure` | Internal Job Router service |
| `stuck_pending_with_matching_runners` / `no_updates_running` / `no_updates_canceling` | Runner heartbeat / job-state-machine issues |
| `stale_schedule` | Delayed jobs (`when: delayed`) left in `scheduled` state > 1h past their `scheduled_at`, dropped by `Ci::StuckBuilds::DropScheduledService`. Check the stuck-builds cron and `BuildScheduleWorker` processing |
| `stuck_or_timeout_failure` (legacy) | Stuck builds cron, runner tag mismatches, plan-gating issues (pre-19.0 jobs only) |

> `unknown_failure` is **not** counted by this SLI. If it dominates on the "Job failures - others" panel, investigate runner-side failure reasons not recognised by Rails (often pointing to a new Runner version emitting an unmapped string).

### 2. Check Runner Fleet Health

- [CI Runners dashboard](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/ci-runners-main) for runner availability
- Look for node-level issues, pod evictions, or autoscaling problems

### 3. Check Gitaly Health

Gitaly overload causes job clone/fetch failures that surface as `runner_system_failure`:

- [Gitaly dashboard](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/gitaly-main) for latency and error rates

### 4. Check Registry/Dependency Proxy

Image pull failures also surface as `runner_system_failure`:

- [Registry dashboard](https://dashboards.gitlab.net/d/registry-main) for error rates

### 5. Check for Incident Correlation

Infrastructure incidents (Gitaly DDoS, runner fleet issues, database problems) often cause spikes in this SLI. Check `#production` and `#incident-management` for ongoing incidents.

## Possible Resolutions

No past incidents have been recorded yet for this alert. This section will be updated as incidents occur.

## Dependencies

- **CI Runners**: Runner fleet availability and health
- **Gitaly**: Git clone/fetch operations within jobs
- **Container Registry**: Image pulls for job containers
- **PostgreSQL (CI)**: Job state recording

## Escalation

### When to Escalate

- Single failure reason > 20% of total failures
- `runner_system_failure` spike correlated with runner fleet degradation
- Alert persists > 1 hour with no identified cause

### Support Channels

- `#s_verify_alerts` (primary)
- `#g_runner` (Runner team — for runner_system_failure)
- `#g_pipeline-execution` (Pipeline Execution team)
- `#production` (if S2+ severity)
